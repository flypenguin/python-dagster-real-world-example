# Real World Dagster Example

I tried to use [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) for a project, and kinda failed spectacularly.

So I thought I would start exploring the data pipeline, sensor, asset & operation concepts
using a really stupid mock example, which models my real-world use case.

I think I succeeded. Kinda. Sorta.

There is also a blog post on [flypenguin.de](https://flypenguin.de) about it.

I think this will help any dagster beginners **greatly** when getting started, because
the official documentation is rather sparse.

The commits in this repository follow the steps in the blog post.
